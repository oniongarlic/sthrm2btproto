This README describe a probable protocol specification of the ST-HRM2 Bluetooth HRM belt.

If you have anything to add to this, please let me know!

SPP Service, easy to connect with plain RFCOMM, data can be viewed with 

sudo cat /dev/rfcomm0 | hexdump

The data dumps are made with the simple helper script, bthrm-data-dumpper.sh

The device sends out data packets every second, the length varies, the contents
and possible meaning described below:

1. 0xFA Start of data packet
2. Sequence number going up from 0x44 to 0x47
3. Sequence number going down from 0xBB to 0xB8
** The sum of 2 and 3 seem to always be 0xFF
4. 0x81 Seen to be 0x01 on first connect, but after that stays at 0x81
5. 0x?? Varies, most likely battery charge information, as it is large after charge and then goes down
6. 0x?? Heart rate measurement, the value we are looking for
7. 0x00 7-10 sometimes have values, sometime they 0x00
8. 0x00 
9. 0x00
10 0x00 
10. Padding of 6,7,9 zeroes, amount varies
11. Packet ends with two bytes, most likely a checksum
